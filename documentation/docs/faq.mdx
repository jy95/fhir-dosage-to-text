<details>
<summary>How can I contribute ?</summary>

Any contribution is welcome! Read more [here](contributing).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I customize the default behavior of the library ?</summary>

The library was built with that in mind. Read more [here](demo/custom).

<details>
<summary>Compatibility Matrix</summary>

| Version              | FHIR        |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `>= 1.0.0` (current) | `R4 and R5` |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why the minimal FHIR version is R4 ?</summary>

Several reasons :

- FHIR version R4 is the most widely used version of FHIR, as stated by [many actors like HAPI FHIR creators](https://smilecdr.com/docs/fhir_repository/fhir_versions.html)
- Many tools don't care anymore for older versions
- It fits my needs when I designed this project

:::tip

You can migrate your dosages from R3 to R4 quick easily, as it is just a matter to putting `dose[x]` / `rate[x]` under `doseAndRate`.

<details>
<summary>How can I customize or add my own language ?</summary>

You can choose your preferred way :

1. Make a pull request on the repository : simply add translations files [for your locale](https://github.com/jy95/fhir-dosage-utils/tree/main/src/locales).
2. Use a [i18next backend](https://www.i18next.com/overview/plugins-and-utils#backends) like [showcast in documentation](custom/i18nConfig)

You can use [English files](https://github.com/jy95/fhir-dosage-utils/tree/main/src/locales/en) for reference.

<details>
<summary>Which languages are currently built-in ?</summary>

4 [locales](https://github.com/jy95/fhir-dosage-utils/tree/main/src/locales) are currently implemented :

1. "en" (English)
2. "fr" (French)
3. "nl" (Dutch)
4. "de" (German)

<details>
<summary>Which FHIR extensions should you support ?</summary>

- Your country extensions (e.g. [Belgian ones](https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/))
- [FHIR Extensions Pack](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/artifacts.html) (for international and interoperability reasons)

Currently, 5 extensions are known to have impacts with Dosage / Timing with [FHIR Extensions Pack](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/artifacts.html) :

- [Conditions](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/StructureDefinition-dosage-conditions.html)
- [Days of cycle](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/StructureDefinition-timing-daysOfCycle.html)
- [Timing day of month](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/StructureDefinition-timing-dayOfMonth.html)
- [Timing Exact](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/StructureDefinition-timing-exact.html)
- [Minimum Gap Between Doses](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/StructureDefinition-dosage-minimumGapBetweenDose.html)
