<summary>Compatibility Matrix</summary>

| Version              | FHIR        |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `>= 1.0.0` (current) | `R4 and R5` |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why the minimal FHIR version is R4 ?</summary>

Several reasons :

- FHIR version R4 is the most widely used version of FHIR, as stated by [many actors like HAPI FHIR creators](https://smilecdr.com/docs/fhir_repository/fhir_versions.html)
- Many tools don't care anymore for older versions
- It fits my needs when I designed this project

:::tip

You can migrate your dosages from R3 to R4 quick easily, as it is just a matter to putting `dose[x]` / `rate[x]` under `doseAndRate`.

<summary>How can I customize or add my own language ?</summary>

You can choose your preferred way :

1. Make a pull request on the repository : simply add translations files [for your locale](https://github.com/jy95/fhir-dosage-utils/tree/main/src/locales).
2. Use a [i18next backend](https://www.i18next.com/overview/plugins-and-utils#backends) like [showcast in documentation](custom/i18nConfig)

You can use [English files](https://github.com/jy95/fhir-dosage-utils/tree/main/src/locales/en) for reference.
