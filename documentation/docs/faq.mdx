<summary>Compatibility Matrix</summary>

| Version              | FHIR        |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `>= 1.0.0` (current) | `R4 and R5` |

<details>
<summary>Why the minimal FHIR version is R4 ?</summary>

Several reasons :

- FHIR version R4 is the most widely used version of FHIR, as stated by [many actors like HAPI FHIR creators](https://smilecdr.com/docs/fhir_repository/fhir_versions.html)
- Many tools don't care anymore for older versions
- It fits my needs when I designed this project

:::tip

You can migrate your dosages from R3 to R4 quick easily, as it is just a matter to putting `dose[x]` / `rate[x]` under `doseAndRate`.
