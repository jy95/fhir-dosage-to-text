We're thrilled to announce a new feature in our library that empowers users to tailor i18next configuration to their preferences.
i18next, the internationalization framework, plays a crucial role in facilitating multilingual support. Now, with this enhancement, users have greater control over how i18next behaves within our system.

Benefits :

- **Flexibility** : Users can adapt i18next settings to suit their project's needs, ensuring a seamless internationalization experience.
- **Customization** : Fine-tune language-related functionalities, such as pluralization rules or date formatting, to match project specifications.
- **Ease of Integration** : Our library seamlessly integrates with existing i18next workflows, minimizing implementation hurdles.
